RetroBat is a set of Batch and Powershell scripts used to easily configure and launch EmulationStation. This frontend software is intended to gather your ROMs collection and run games with compatible emulators such as RetroArch.

RetroBat can download and install all the softwares you need to have a good retrogaming experience on your PC.

RetroBat is designed to run in Portable Mode. It means that you can either start it from HDD or from any removable storage device, as long as you do it on a computer that meets the requirements.
