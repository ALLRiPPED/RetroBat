**RetroBat will never provide ROMs or BIOS files.**

## Compiling

To read and build retrobat.mfa sources file you need a legit copy of Fusion 2.5 developper.

To build .nsi files you need the NullSoft Scriptable Install System.

I've written a script to facilitate retrobat packaging and compilation. Download retro.bat [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/waukftnznp1q3py/nsis.zip?dl=1)|. Use at your own risk!
