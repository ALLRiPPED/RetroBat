**RetroBat will never provide ROMs or BIOS files.**

## Compiling

To read and build retrobat.mfa sources file you need a legit copy of Fusion 2.5 developper.

To build .nsi files you need the NullSoft Scriptable Install System.

I've written a script to facilitate retrobat packaging and compilation. Download retro.bat [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mj9mmq225bm797k/retro.bat?dl=0). Use at your own risk!
