## ðŸ“Œ Presentation

RetroBat is a Windows softwares distribution dedicated to retrogaming and emulation. It provides fully configured EmulationStation frontend with all emulators needed to have the best retrogaming experience on your Windows personnal computer. It share the same EmulationStation with Batocera and EmuELEC, that means all the themes designed for this EmulationStation are compatible with the three distributions and all the improvements made on the interface are available for all the three of them.

With it you will be quickly and easily able to run games from a ROMs collection. You can save a lot of time you can keep to play!

RetroBat is designed to be portable. That means you can start it from HDD or from any removable storage device, as long as you do it on a computer that meets the requirements.

## ðŸ§° Compilation Instructions

<!--
To read and build retrobat.mfa sources file you need a legit copy of Fusion 2.5 developper.

To build .nsi files you need the NullSoft Scriptable Install System.

Why use proprietary development software like Clickteam Fusion 2.5? 

*Until version 2.1, retrobat consisted mainly of a collection of batch and powershell scripts to facilitate the use and configuration of EmulationStation with RetroArch. I didn't originally have any training in software development, I used my few batch skills to start writing these scripts and learned to do it at the same time. As I don't know any other programming language, using Fusion 2.5 allowed me to quickly provide solutions to the evolutionary needs of RetroBat. I'm aware that using commercial software to read and compile the sources prevents those who don't own the software from accessing the sources of retrobat.mfa file. I specify that this constraint exists only for retrobat.mfa file, all other source files are editable with at least a good text editor such as notepad++* - Kayl

You can download [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wp6ed3wlro9x7th/AADQFQCZNQlmhLeo1EqmHoI3a?dl=0) the sources of retrobat.mfa in pdf format to preview the Fusion code.

I've written a script to facilitate retrobat packaging and compilation (WIP):
- [Download and install Git for Windows (follow default setup settings).](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- [Download and extract the retrobat-buildtools (which contain NSIS, wget and strip).](https://www.dropbox.com/s/52nyaowovzyz6jd/retrobat-buildtools.zip?dl=1)
- Clone this github then run build.bat to launch the build routine.
